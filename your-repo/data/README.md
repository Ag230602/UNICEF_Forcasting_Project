# DFGCN: Uncertainty-Aware Risk & Recovery Planning Dashboard

This repository contains an end-to-end **uncertainty-aware decision support system** for disaster risk assessment and recovery planning.  
It integrates spatio-temporal modeling, risk scoring, and interactive visualization into a **Streamlit-based dashboard** designed for **early-action and preparedness decision-making**.

---

##  Project Overview


The system is designed to help decision-makers answer questions such as:

- **Where is risk highest under uncertainty?**
- **Which regions need immediate attention vs monitoring?**
- **How do recovery timelines vary spatially?**
- **How can forecasts be translated into actionable insights?**

The dashboard combines:
- Forecast-driven risk indicators
- Vulnerability-aware scoring
- Interactive geospatial visualization
- Clear, non-technical decision cues
